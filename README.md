# circuit_reversing
found the correct inputs for a combinational logic circuit that makes an led glow. I have previous experience working with logic circuits sso this wasn't really difficult for me atleast. It was fun solving the logic.
# L3D_Tr4c3R
I just had to make a circuit that makes 3 LEDs turn on in a chasing pattern, with an Arduino Nam=no. Wasn't all that challenging beacause i have experience working with Arduinos.
# IRC
logged into a channel named #bi0sHardware on LiberaChat
# WiFi_Hacking-1
I wasn't able to solve this but i learned a few things about what aircrack-ng is and how it can be used to hack. I also learned a few things about what wireshark is and how to use it.
# da_0n3_wh3r3_u_v1su4l1s3
I downloaded a text file, which I opened to see that it was not a readable text file, so i used a hex editor and saw that the text file was actually an image. So I corrected the file signature for the jfif file and opened it to reveal the flag.
# Dots&Dashes
Downloaded an audio file and decoded the morse code in the audio file. Learnt how to decode morse code using online software.
# chan's favourite
downloaded an audio file and played it whic had nothing intelligible, so i used audacity to try making a heat graph for the audio, which revealed an image of Rick Astley, which was the flag.
# ~logic
solved a combinational logic circuit that made an led glow, then entered the values into a simulation of an Arduino Uno with an LCD display connected to it, then entered the values of A,B,C and D for which the led had glown, which revealed the flag.
# find_thyself
downloaded an image of an outlet. I noticed that it was the outlet type used in Italy. Then I entered the flag as italy.
# ain't_no_sunshine!
I wired a circuit up according to the given circuit diagram, and connected the arduino to my laptop and extracted the flag from the serial monitor.
# grep_it
downloaded a file with no extension. After reading the challenge name, I opened a terminal window and used the command called grep to search for the flag.
# D0Z3N_IS_K3Y
Used the grep command on the provided attachment and found a cipher text, which used a Cipher identifier to identify which type of cipher it was and decoded the cipher text to reveal the flag.
# Lifetimesettlement
Opened the challenge and saw a string of 1s and 0s, initially i thought it was binary, then i tried to decode it into text. It did not work so i thought it might be some kind of cipher, so i tried to identify what type of cipher it was. I saw that it was a spoon type cipher.
# Ceasarcipher
used a Ceasarcipher decoder to decrypt the ciphertext. learned the basics of ceaser cipher encryption 
# da_french_cipher
searched google for french cipher and used a vigenere cipher decoder to decrypt the ciphertext
#I2C_FOR_LYF
Recieved two Arduino Nanos placed on a breadboard, where i had to figure out what to do to make the Arduinos communicate. I have some experience working with I2C communication protocol, so I know that there has to be a serial data line and a serial clock line, so i searched google for the default SDA and SCL pins of an Arduino Nano. Once i found out the SDA and SCL pins of the Arduino, I connected the respective pins and downloaded the software required for the Logic analyser then used the logic analyser to record the communicated data. I then saw that the data was in hexadecimal, which i decoded to obtain the flag. 
# Î¼Py_flag
I recived an esp8266 module from which i had to extract the flag. I connected the module to my laptop, then I tried to use the Arduino IDE to open the serial monitor. It did not work because the required drivers were not installed. I installed the necessary drivers and then used the serial monitor again. the module printed junk values onto the serial monitor. I then tried different baud rates, for which 115200 baud showed a text saying "you are close". That meant I found the correct baud rate. I then changed the serial monitor option to shaw Newline and Carriage Return. Then i tried sending the command print(flag) to the module which returned a cipher text which i decoded to find the flag.
# Sanity Check - 1
Joined the Discord server which had the flag on a channel.
